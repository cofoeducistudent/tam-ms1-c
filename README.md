## **PROJECT MANDATE**

An independent film company **Black Eagle films(BEF)** are in the process of releasing a horror flick on halloween 2019 called **“The Attachment”**. They need a website developer to create a basic static web site that will aid them in promoting the film.  

## **EXTERNAL USER GOAL**
Black Eagle films anticipate the site users or customers are movie-goers and some are horror film fans who appreciate a low-budget horror.Been in business for some time BEF have an idea about their market.

* Typically, users wish to find out about upcoming films, see images from the movie, and of course a trailer  to whet their appetite.

* In addition, they like to see or find out something about the production.

* If interested,  users normally like the option to contact the film promoters if they have any questions, such as what the certification rating is expected to be when the film is released and where it will be shown.

## **SITE OWNER GOAL**
From Black Eagle Film’s perspective, they wish the site to be a first step in their film promotion stratergy, providing the above typically expected information to their customers.

They wish the site to reflect the nature of the film and **not pander to 'gore-slasher' type material**.

They wish to capture some basic details of their potential customers, by giving them the option to provide email, names, and any other comments.

They wish this information to be used in future promotion or marketing endeavours.

Therefore, Black Eagle Films have asked for the site to:
1.	Have a nice clean fresh and simple look with a colour scheme that fits the material. They will supply images.
2.	They wish to show picture stills and/or  promotional material for the film to entice the audience.
3.	They also wish to show a movie trailer to help entice the audience, wheting their appetite.
4.	Finally  they wish to collect basic contact details from users for future promotional and marketing endeavours.

## Advanced potential features
Black Eagle Films have indicated that in the future, there is a chance that they would wish the website to be capable of sending messages back to their fans utilising the contact details gathered. **However, they have agreed that this feature will fall under a different release**.

# **Project purpose**
The purpose of this project is to create an initial web  prescence in the form of a basic static website for the soon to be released feature film '**THE ATTACHMENT'** from Black Eagle Films.

Black Eagle Films will be the owner of the site and will be refered to in this document as BEF.

BEF have said that they require five things from the initial site release.
1. One is an asthetic.
2. The other four are features.
3. Finally they anticipated **( but not green-lit )** another feature for the future.

## Requirements Table:

| Requirement No| Item | Classification |
| -------------- |:----------------------:|:-------------| 
|1 | Clean simple look & a suitable color scheme | Asthetic |
|2|Have Pictures & Promo info |Feature|
|3|Production/Behind The scenes|Feature|
|4|Movie Trailer|Feature|
|5|Collect user data / Contact Section|Feature|
|6|Post communication to users|Out-of-scope

### **We will remove the final feature as this is not green-lit** and I think it will be more backend when delivered. Indeed, if a front end section is required it will be implemenmt using an admin login credential to stop harassment mailing. Also we will most probably need to integrate a special page for the administrator or owner to access such a feature. In short this feature will be demed curently out of scope.

### When further quizzed as to the nature of promo-material wanted on the site. BEF eloborated that they will provide a **press-kit pdf** file for download, as this is typicaly used by press and festivals etc. They will also provide the images and stills for the site.

# Approach

The appoach I have decided to use in completing the project and site design is the five stage User design priciple.

* Stratergy
* Scope
* Structure
* Skeleton
* Surface


# UX Design

Further discussions to flesh out the requirements and scope,Black Eagle films anticipate this website will be the best way of engaging their audience initially, as most of them will have access to computers or mobile devices and are used to watching media content in its various forms.

In addition using the internet and web-technologies will allow them to capitalise on a broader geographic location for targeting with significantly reduced cost.

This is important because as an independent film producing company, they have limited funding.

The **features that have been decided on** between Me(Webdesigner) & BEF are as follows:
1.	Navigation bar
2.	About section
3.	Trailer section
4.	Behind-the-scenes section
5.	Contact form
6. Download Presss-Kit Feature 
to validate the necessity for these features I have provided user stories to support them.

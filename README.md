### A website for Black Eagle films
# “The Attachment” Movie

 
## PROJECT MANDATE

An independent film company Black Eagle films are in the process of producing a horror flick called “The Attachment”. They need a website developer to create a basic static web site that will aid them in promoting the film.  

## EXTERNAL USER GOAL
Black Eagle films anticipate the site users or customers are moviegoers and some are horror film fans who appreciate a low-budget horror.
Through being in business for some time they have some idea about their market. Typically, users wish to find out about upcoming films, its actors, see images from the movie, and of course a trailer or 2 to whet their appetite. In addition, they like to see some behind-the-scenes footage and stills. Finally, they normally like the option to contact the film promoters if they have any questions, such as what the certification rating is expected to be when the film is released and where it will be shown.

## SITE OWNER GOAL
From Black Eagle Film’s perspective, they wish the site to help promote their film, providing typically expected information to their customers.
In addition, they wish to capture some basic details of their potential customers, by giving them the option to provide an email, names and addresses, and any other comments.
They envisage this information to be used in future promotional and marketing endeavours.

Therefore, initially, Black Eagle Films have asked for the site to:
1. Have a nice clean fresh and simple look and a colour scheme that fits the material. 
2. They wish to be able to show picture stills and promotional material for the film to entice the audience.
3. They also wish to provide profiles for the actors, helping to promote their careers.
4. They also wish to be able to provide a movie trailer or 2 to help entice your audience and whet their appetite.
5. Importantly they also wish to collect contact details from potential customers. They will leave this information for future promotional and marketing endeavours.

Advanced potential features
1. Black Eagle Films have also specified that in the future there is a chance that they would wish the website to be capable of sending messages to their fans utilising the contact details they have gathered. They have agreed that this feature will fall under a different release.

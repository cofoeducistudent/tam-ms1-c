## **PROJECT MANDATE**

An independent film production company **Black Eagle films(BEF)** are in the process of releasing a horror flick on halloween 2019 called **“The Attachment”**. They need a website developer to create a basic static web site that will aid them in promoting the film.  

## **EXTERNAL USER GOAL**
Black Eagle films anticipate the site users or customers are movie-goers and some are horror film fans who appreciate a low-budget horror.Been in business for some time BEF have an idea about their market.

* Typically, users wish to find out about upcoming films, see images from the movie, and of course a trailer  to whet their appetite.

* In addition, they like to see or find out something about the production.

* If interested,  users normally like the option to contact the film promoters if they have any questions, such as what the certification rating is expected to be when the film is released and where it will be shown.

## **SITE OWNER GOAL**
From Black Eagle Film’s perspective, they wish the site to be a first step in their promotion stratergy for the film , providing typically expected information to their customers.

They wish the site to reflect the nature of the film and **not pander to 'gore-slasher' type materials**.

They wish to capture some basic details of their potential customers, by giving them the option to provide email, names, and any other comments.

They wish this information to be used in future promotion or marketing endeavours.

Therefore, Black Eagle Films have asked for the site to:
1.	Have a nice clean fresh and simple look with a colour scheme that fits the material. They will supply images.
2.	They wish to show picture stills and/or  promotional material for the film to entice the audience.
3.	They also wish to show a movie trailer to help entice the audience, wheting their appetite.
4.	Finally  they wish to collect basic contact details from users for future promotional and marketing endeavours.

## Advanced potential features
**Black Eagle Films have indicated that in the future, there is a chance that they would wish the website to be capable of sending messages back to their fans utilising the contact details gathered. However, they have agreed that this feature will fall under a different release**.

# **Project purpose**
**The purpose of this project then, is to create an initial web  prescence in the form of a basic static website for the soon to be released feature film 'THE ATTACHMENT' from Black Eagle Films.**

**Black Eagle Films will be the owner of the site after deployment, and I will be refer to them in this document as BEF for simplicity.**.

BEF have said that they require five things from the initial site release.
1. One is an asthetic.
2. The other four are features.
3. Finally they anticipated **( but not green-lit )** another feature for the future.

## Requirements Table:

| Requirement No| Item | Classification |
| -------------- |:----------------------:|:-------------| 
|1 | Clean simple look & a suitable color scheme | Asthetic |
|2|Have Pictures & Promo info |Feature|
|3|Production/Behind The scenes|Feature|
|4|Movie Trailer|Feature|
|5|Collect user data / Contact Section|Feature|
|6|Post communication to users|Out-of-scope

 We will place feature -6- as Out of scope OOS, this is **not green-lit** and I suspect will be a mixture of back-end and front-end when delivered. Indeed, if a front end section is required it will be likley implemented using an admin login credential to stop harassment mailing. 
 
 Also we will most probably need to integrate a special page for the administrator or owner to access such a feature. In short this feature will be demed curently out of scope.



## When further quizzed as to the nature of promo-material wanted on the site. BEF eloborated that they will provide a **press-kit pdf** file for download, as this is typicaly used by press and festivals etc. They will also provide the images and stills for the site.

# Approach

The appoach I have decided to use in completing the project and site design is the five stage User design principle.

* Stratergy
* Scope
* Structure
* Skeleton
* Surface


# UX Design

Following further discussions to flesh out the requirements and scope, Black Eagle films said this website will be the best way of engaging their audience initially, as most of their target audiience have access to computers or mobile devices and are comfortable watching media content in its various forms.

In addition using the internet and web-technologies will allow them to capitalise on a broader geographic regions with significantly reduced capital expenditure.

This is important because as an independent film producing company, they have limited funding.

The **features that have been decided on** between Me(Webdesigner) & BEF are as follows:
1.	Navigation bar
2.	About section
3.	Trailer section
4.	Behind-the-scenes section
5.	Contact form
6. Download Presss-Kit Feature 
to validate the necessity for these features I have provided user stories to support them.

# Stratergy

Following clarification of BEF's requirements for their website I have dicided on the following approach. 

* The website shall be a simple single page scroller with multiple sections. It will have a navigation bar at the top. The Navigation bar will allow the user to navigate to different sections further down the page.

* I have put to BEF, that  many people have **smart phones capable of web access**, which is only increasing in volume yer by year. The chances are first point of contact with the film protion material, should be the phone.
People are more comfortable with scroling on a small touch screen phone while on the move than trying to read the navigation bar. Its more natural.Also they will not be on the site for typing in large bits of data, rather absorbing the info. Therfore even the section for supplying contact details should be limited and brief ( Atleast at first contact).

* I also highlighted the fact that the film medium on release may actually be consumed on a smartphone. For may people this is a norm, especially if the film is placed on a streaming service such as Netflix or Amazon.

* We shall have a navigation bar also, because although we will be employing **mobile first design principles**. We do envisage other members of their audince having access to computers and tellivison also. The latter frequently does not hav touch screen capabilities in a significant volume.

* I have also decided to go with a plain light background in contrast to my initial thoughts. This will allow for the clean fresh look. BEF have been clear that the film is not to be confused with standard horror gore, therefore I will avoid any references to blood and guts imagery.

* BEF has said in conversation, it is a spooky drama, rather than a horror and they also want to gain a wider scope of fans for the film.

* My initial thoughts were to have the site on a predominat dark/black background, but this would lean towards the type of film that BEF wish to differentiate theselves from.

 Indeed from my conversations I gathered BEF wish to capture as much of an audience as possible, for which they avoided filming any scenes taht would push up their certification rating. 
 
 BEF wish the film to be promoted as a spooky tea-time mystery, and has said the film does not contain nudity or strong foul language. They also say it has has an intended positive message with a christian slant, and they wish it to be certified as a PG.
This has clarified and convinced me that I should avoid anything contentious, and pursue a direction that won't upset people by misrepresenting this fact.

### **The sections on the single scroll page will be as follows:**
* **About** - To quickly inform the user in breif about the film.
* **Trailer** - Show a trailer from the film
I have placed this second in order , as people usually wish to get to the meat and potatoes quickly.
* **Production** -A small bit about the production of the film
* **Contact** - A section providing a means for the users to contact BEF & allow BEF to collect the email addresses
* **Download** - Press Kit Section , allowing anyone intrested to get access to more indepth material.


To Validtae the need for the features, I carried out a user story process.

# User Stories

|User Story Element|User Type| Feature|Reason/Goal|
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
|1|As a User|I need a Navigation-bar|So that I can navigate through the site easily|
|2|As a User|I need an About section|So, I can quickly understand what the site is about|
|3|As a User|I need a Trailer section|So that I can view her section of the film to see if it's a kind of film I like|
|4|As a User|I need a behind-the-scenes section|So that I can understand what type of film production it is and if it's something that is of interest to me|
|5|As a User|I need a contacts form or page|So that I can find out a bit more about the film if I need to|
|6|As an Owner|I need a navigation bar|So that I can navigate through the site easily|
|7|As an Owner|I need an About section|So that I can tell potential users quickly what the film is about|
|8|As an Owner|I need a trailer section|So that I can entice potential users to come to see the film|
|9|As an Owner|I need a behind the scenes section|So that I can satisfy interest from users - film fans|
|10|As an Owner|I need a contacts form|So that I can gather contact information and data from my users|

# Structure



BEF want a basic site for initial promotion. 

They may wish for a more elaborate construct in the future. However, at present having the information data content **integrated within the html** file means I will not need to involve a database such as **MySql**  or other data retrival methods to read the data from.

**Structure data** is inherent within html

**Information data** presented on the site is intregrated within the HTML file.

**Color and format data**, will be held within a CSS file

**Bootstrap 4** will be used predominantly to construct the site

## File Layout

![File Layout Structure](assets/support/site-filestructure.png)

I will implement the above filestructure for the website

The **ROOT** folder will hold all the other folders -

|ROOT|ASSETS|CSS|IMAGES|SUPPORT|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|index.html|-|-|-|-|
|submission.html|-|-|-|-|
|README.md|-|-|-|-|
|.gitignore|-|-|-|-|
|-|CSS|style.css|various images for website|various images for README.md|
|ASSETS|-|-|-|-|

                    <p>
                        As a small independent film company our latest endeavour <span class="stand-out-this">“The
                            Attachment”</span> was by far our
                        most challenging production to date. Set across different time periods, our story begins in
                        the leafy suburbs of London, United Kingdom during the early 1980s with our protagonist at a
                        tender age of 6 years old. Shooting a biopic of this calibre took a lot of energy planning
                        and good fortune. Shot entirely on location around London area, our small production team
                        were certainly put to task in controlling every aspect of filmmaking process in order to
                        deliver this satisfying supernatural drama. Made on a very small budget, the film has
                        impressed many and has even one festival recognition.It’s not a film for everyone, but that
                        people who like their horror films interesting and gentle without the traditional blood and
                        gore.It was a passion project for first time director Clement Ofoedu, who we caught up with
                        and spared us a few minutes for an interview.<p>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> So how did you get involved in this film?<br><br>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">CO:</span> The attachment was a script I wrote after making
                            a couple of small short films. I wanted
                            to progress onto writing a feature. It’s not a film I expect to win loads of accolades.
                            But
                            it was more of a passion project for me to push myself into doing something different
                            after
                            a battle with cancer.<br><br>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> Oh, so you wrote it and I noticed you directed
                            it. Was that a wise choice?<br><br>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">CO</span>: Well, it served a purpose for me. Firstly, I
                            wanted to learn the process of filmmaking
                            especially feature, and it was highly unlikely that a first-time filmmaker not raised in
                            the
                            industry would be offered the Helms of a feature film. Therefore, I decided if I was
                            going
                            to make a feature film, I’d better write it and direct it. Directing is a lot harder
                            than it
                            looks.To be honest if I do say around a few more minutes and had a deeper think I may
                            have
                            passed on it. I just did not realise how much effort it would take. There is a reason
                            the
                            many films do not get finished. Money is one element that come sink your project fast,
                            and
                            the other is effort and harnessing the necessary skills to be able to pull it
                            off.<br><br>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> You mention money. In fact, there is something I
                            wanted to ask you how much this cost?<br><br>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">O:</span> Oh, the film was made on personal funds. I
                            decided to opt for this approach rather than
                            crowdsourcing. My reasoning was that I had to try to learn filmmaking, direct and
                            produce at
                            the same time was a big enough obstacle, without needing to have fun and games with a
                            finance department when you be stressed out, trying to keep things running. Making a
                            film is
                            a bit like lighting a fire and letting it burn. It can be done we have to keep an eye on
                            it
                            and tend to rip constantly to make sure it doesn’t burn our control and cause serious
                            damage.<br><br>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> Really?<br><br>
                            <span class="stand-out-this">CO:</span> Absolutely. When you think about it making a
                            short film is a completely different
                            experience. You have a few people gather together to make a film of short duration
                            perhaps 5
                            to 10 minutes. Apart from preproduction which could take a few months depending on how
                            intricate the film is, during production and principal photography, the team will only
                            spend
                            at Max a few days to a week together.And of course, at the other end there is
                            postproduction, which is the different experience having its own unique challenges.Part
                            of
                            that is because momentum has died down. However, in the feature film you have people
                            together in proximity for weeks or months at an end.This raises another problem and that
                            is
                            friction between people that normally wouldn’t be near one another. They may be good at
                            their job, but that doesn’t always translate as being the most sociable person.
                            Therefore,
                            as an independent filmmaker you’re always firefighting, and desperately doing everything
                            to
                            dispel that friction and prevent the film set from going nuclear.One of the worst things
                            that can happen apart from things a full firmly within health and safety, is that an
                            actor
                            decides to quit the film.This generally doesn’t happen but if the perfect storm is
                            created
                            where there are crew or other actors who constantly come into conflict, then there is a
                            serious chance of such a problem developing.These are the subtle things you really told
                            about in film school. As an independent filmmaker frequently you’re also the director
                            who is
                            tasked with not only directing the film but playing diplomat to ensure the film is
                            completed
                            at least as far as principal photography goes.<br><br>

                        many years in his times as a
                        member of the priesthood. The ground is solid. It can be said perhaps of this place, that it
                        has
                        strong bones. Looking at it serenely now, it’s hard to imagine, that many years past
                        Father
                        Malachi experienced what was to be an omen. Evil chooses a place to make itself known
                        and is happy to do it in no
                        stranger a place than what he once believed was hallowed ground. Perhaps a warning to us
                        all
                        that all is not as it seems in life.

                    <!-- <img class="make-images-universal-size1" src="" alt="" /> -->
                    <p>
                        As a small independent film company, our latest endeavour <span class="stand-out-this">“The
                            Attachment”</span> was by far our
                        most challenging production to date. Set across different periods, our story begins in
                        the leafy suburbs of London, United Kingdom during the early 1980s with our protagonist at a
                        tender age of 6 years old. Shooting a biopic of this calibre took a lot of energy planning
                        and good fortune. Shot entirely on location around London area, our small production team
                        were certainly put to task in controlling every aspect of the filmmaking process to
                        deliver this satisfying supernatural drama. Made on a very small budget, the film has
                        impressed many and has even one festival recognition. It’s a film for people who like their
                        horror films interesting and gentle without the traditional blood and
                        gore. It was a passion project for the first-time director Clement Ofoedu, who we caught up with
                        and spared us a few minutes for an interview.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> So how did you get involved in this film?
                    </p>


                    <p><span class="stand-out-this">CO:</span> The Attachment was a screenplay I wrote after making
                        a couple of small short films. I wanted
                        to progress onto writing a feature. It’s not a film I expect to win loads of accolades.
                        But
                        it was more of a passion project for me to push myself into doing something different
                        after
                        a battle with cancer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> Oh, so you wrote it and I noticed you directed
                        it. Was that a wise choice?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this"></span></p>


                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this">CO</span>: Well, it served a purpose for me. Firstly, I
                        wanted to learn the process of filmmaking
                        especially feature, and it was highly unlikely that a first-time filmmaker not raised in
                        the
                        industry would be offered the Helms of a feature film. Therefore, I decided if I was
                        going
                        to make a feature film, I’d better write it and direct it. Directing is a lot harder
                        than it
                        looks. To be honest, if I do say around a few more minutes and had a deeper think I may
                        have
                        passed on it. I just did not realise how much effort it would take. There is a reason
                        many films do not get finished. Money is one element that can sink your project fast,
                        and
                        the other is effort and harnessing the necessary skills to be able to pull it
                        off.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> You mention money. There is something I
                        wanted to ask. How much did this cost?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this">O:</span> Oh, the film was made on personal funds. I
                        decided to opt for this approach rather than crowdfunding. I reasoned that I had to try to learn
                        filmmaking, direct and
                        produce at the same time was a big enough obstacle, without needing to have fun and games with a
                        finance department when you be stressed out, trying to keep things running. Making a
                        film is a bit like lighting a fire and letting it burn. It can be done, but one has to keep an
                        eye on
                        the flames, as it tends to burn our control easily and cause serious damage to its surroundings
                        and especially wallet.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this">Q:</span> Really?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="stand-out-this">CO:</span> Absolutely. When you think about it making a
                        short film is a completely different
                        experience. You have a few people gather together to make a film of short duration
                        perhaps 5
                        to 10 minutes. Apart from preproduction which could take a few months depending on how
                        intricate the film is, during production and principal photography, the team will only
                        spend
                        at Max a few days to a week together. And of course, at the other end, there is
                        postproduction, which is the different experience having its unique challenges. Part
                        of
                        that is because momentum has died down. However, in a feature film shoot, you have people
                        together in proximity for weeks or months at an end. This raises another problem,
                        friction between people that normally wouldn’t be near one another. They may be good at
                        their job, but that doesn’t always translate as being the most sociable person.
                        Therefore, as an independent filmmaker, you’re continually firefighting. Desperately
                        doing everything to dispel friction and prevent the film-set from going nuclear.
                        One of the worst things that can happen apart from health and safety issues, is that an actor
                        decides to quit the film. This generally doesn’t happen but if the perfect storm materializes,
                        where the crew or other actors who constantly aggravate one-another, come into conflict for an
                        extended period, there is a
                        serious chance of such a situation occurring. These are subtle things you rarely told
                        about in film school. As an independent filmmaker, you are also frequently the director
                        tasked with not only directing the film but playing diplomat to ensure the film is
                        completed.
